### Cloning and Running Scripts on Ubuntu System

To clone the WARPWireGuardGenerator repository and execute its scripts on an Ubuntu system, follow these step-by-step instructions. Make sure you already have Python installed on your system before proceeding.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
Open a terminal in Ubuntu and run the following command to clone the WARPWireGuardGenerator repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/us254/WARPWireGuardGenerator.git
```

**Step 2: Navigate to the Cloned Directory**
Move into the directory of the cloned repository:

```bash
cd WARPWireGuardGenerator
```

**Step 3: Make main.sh Executable**
Before running `main.sh`, ensure it has execution permissions. Use the following command to make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x main.sh
```

**Step 4: Run main.sh**
Execute the `main.sh` script. If it requires root permissions or system file interaction, consider using `sudo`:

```bash
./main.sh
```

Or with root permissions:

```bash
sudo ./main.sh
```

Follow any on-screen instructions provided by `main.sh`.

**Step 5: Install Python Requirements (Optional)**
If `warp-key-generator.py` has external dependencies, install them. Use the provided `requirements.txt` file or follow specific instructions in the repository:

```bash
pip install httpx
```

Use `pip3` if needed for Python 3 installations.

**Step 6: Make warp-key-generator.py Executable**
Ensure the Python script is executable similar to `main.sh`:

```bash
chmod +x warp-key-generator.py
```

**Step 7: Run warp-key-generator.py**
Execute the `warp-key-generator.py` script using `python` or `python3` depending on your system's Python setup:

```bash
./warp-key-generator.py
```

Or with `python`:

```bash
python warp-key-generator.py
```

Or with `python3` if needed:

```bash
python3 warp-key-generator.py
```

That's it! You've successfully cloned the repository, executed `main.sh`, and run `warp-key-generator.py`. Pay attention to any output or instructions from these scripts for the desired outcome. ðŸš€
